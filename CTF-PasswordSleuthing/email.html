            <p>Agent,</p>
            <p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves deciphering the digital footprint of a suspect, Jane Doe. Your objective is to access her secure files by hacking into her system using login credentials that we believe are formed by data present on her personal biography.</p>
            <p>Be vigilant and pay close attention to <strong>dates, significant numbers, and names</strong> embedded within her biography. These elements are often used in constructing passwords and could be crucial in your quest. Remember, the devil is in the details!</p>
            <p>Start your mission by analyzing the biography at the link below. Your skills in observation and pattern recognition will be your greatest allies.</p>

            <p>This message will self-destruct in five seconds... scratch that, we don't have the budget for self-destructing messages anymore. But do act swiftly and discreetly!</p>
